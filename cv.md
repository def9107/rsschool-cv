## Summary
My first job was a sales assistant in a cellphone store. That was a great time of rising smartphones. It’s really amazing when you’re one of the first people in city, who receive a new models and can explore new technologies! That job required non-stop education. But it was not so difficult, it was very exciting. Definitely, it was bigger than just a work, it was a hobby! So I decide that my job or at least my hobby must be bound up with technologies and education always. My first and base courses is interactive courses HTMLAcademy. Then I found CodeWars and it started! I like that coding is multiple. And the most interesting is to find the best decision. 

My:
* most important goal is **self-actualization**
* strong suit is **curiosity**
* weakness is *indiscipline* and **I'm working on it!**
